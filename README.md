Utilized regression algorithms to predict car prices based on factors such as make, model, mileage, and year.
Employed feature engineering techniques to extract meaningful insights from raw data and improve prediction accuracy.
The models used in this projects are Linear amd Lasso Regression models.
I have also plotted scatter plot graph for both linear and lasso models.
